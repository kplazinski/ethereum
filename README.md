Some basic solidity examples:
* snippets - short codes examples of specific functionalities in solidity
* ERC20 - an ERC20 token example
* PricePredictor - am example of a smart contract where users can send predictions about the price of a product - the user who gave the closest price wins. Includes also HTML page with web3.js (please add the correct ABI and smart contract's address). This web page doesn't show the products which price must be predicted - please show these to users in different ways - via slack for example ;)
